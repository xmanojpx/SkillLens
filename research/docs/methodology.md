# Research Methodology

## Research Title
**"A Study on Resume Preparation Challenges and Skill–Shortlisting Mismatch Among Engineering Students Using AI-Based Career Readiness Analysis"**

---

## 1. Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
To identify and quantify the challenges faced by engineering students in resume preparation and job application processes, with a focus on understanding the gap between student capabilities and industry expectations.

### Specific Research Questions
1. What are the primary difficulties students face in creating effective resumes?
2. To what extent are students aware of why they are rejected or not shortlisted?
3. How does awareness of ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) impact shortlisting success?
4. What is the relationship between resume-job description matching and application success?
5. Is there a demand for AI-based career readiness tools among students?

## 2. Research Design

### Study Type
**Quantitative Cross-Sectional Survey Study**

### Rationale
A quantitative approach was chosen to:
- Obtain measurable, statistical data on student challenges
- Identify correlations between awareness factors and success rates
- Provide empirical evidence to justify the SkillLens solution
- Enable data-driven feature design decisions

---

## 3. Sampling Methodology

### Target Population
Engineering students (Computer Science, Information Technology, and related disciplines) actively seeking employment or internships.

### Sample Size
**n = 100 students**

### Sampling Approach
**Convenience Sampling** with the following considerations:
- Students from various academic years (3rd and 4th year)
- Mix of students with varying levels of job application experience
- Anonymized to ensure honest responses

### Sample Size Justification
A sample of 100 provides:
- Sufficient statistical power for correlation analysis
- Adequate representation of student experiences
- Manageable data collection and analysis scope
- Acceptable margin of error (~10% at 95% confidence level)

## 4. Survey Instrument Design

### Survey Structure
The survey consists of **10 questions** across three categories:

#### Category 1: Self-Assessment (1 question)
- Resume preparation difficulty (5-point Likert scale)

#### Category 2: Awareness & Knowledge (7 questions)
- Rejection reason awareness (Binary: Yes/No)
- Application response rate (Binary: Yes/No)
- Resume-JD matching confidence (Binary: Yes/No)
- Skill requirement knowledge (Binary: Yes/No)
- ATS awareness (Binary: Yes/No)
- Guidance personalization (Binary: Yes/No)
- AI tool utility perception (Binary: Yes/No)

#### Category 3: Application Metrics (2 questions)
- Total applications submitted (Numeric)
- Total shortlists received (Numeric)

### Question Design Principles
1. **Clarity**: Questions use simple, unambiguous language
2. **Relevance**: Each question directly addresses research objectives
3. **Brevity**: Survey completable in 5-7 minutes
4. **Objectivity**: Questions avoid leading or biased phrasing

---

## 5. Data Collection Process

### Data Collection Method
**Structured online survey** distributed via:
- Academic email lists
- Student placement groups
- Campus career services

### Data Collection Period
Academic Year 2024-25

### Response Validation
- Duplicate response prevention (one response per email)
- Completeness checks (no missing values)
- Range validation for numeric fields

---

## 6. Ethical Considerations

### Informed Consent
- Participants informed about research purpose
- Voluntary participation emphasized
- Right to withdraw at any time

### Anonymization
- No personally identifiable information collected
- Candidate IDs randomly assigned (C001-C100)
- No institution names or contact details stored

### Data Privacy
- Data stored securely
- Used solely for research purposes
- No sharing with third parties

### Potential Risks
**Minimal risk** - Survey involves no sensitive personal information or psychological stress

---

## 7. Data Analysis Plan

### Descriptive Statistics
- Mean, median, standard deviation for numeric variables
- Frequency distributions for categorical variables
- Success rate calculations (Shortlists/Applications)

### Inferential Statistics
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation for numeric variables
- **Chi-Square Tests**: Categorical variable relationships (e.g., ATS awareness vs success)
- **Group Comparisons**: t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for comparing groups

### Visualization
- Bar charts for awareness metrics
- Scatter plots for application-shortlist relationships
- Heatmaps for correlation matrices
- Distribution plots for difficulty ratings

---

## 8. Validity and Reliability

### Internal Validity
- Clear operational definitions for all variables
- Standardized survey instrument for all participants
- Consistent data collection process

### External Validity
- Sample representative of engineering students seeking employment
- Findings generalizable to similar student populations
- Limitations acknowledged (convenience sampling)

### Reliability
- Questions based on established career readiness frameworks
- Pilot testing conducted to ensure clarity
- Consistent response patterns indicate reliable measurement

---

## 9. Limitations

### Acknowledged Limitations
1. **Sampling**: Convenience sampling may introduce selection bias
2. **Self-Reporting**: Responses based on self-perception, not objective assessment
3. **Temporal**: Cross-sectional design captures snapshot, not longitudinal trends
4. **Geographic**: Sample may be geographically limited
5. **Response Bias**: Students with negative experiences may be more motivated to respond

### Mitigation Strategies
- Large sample size (n=100) to reduce individual bias impact
- Anonymization to encourage honest responses
- Clear question wording to minimize misinterpretation
- Statistical validation of patterns

## 10. Integration with SkillLens

### Research-to-Product Pipeline
This research directly informs SkillLens development:

1. **Problem Validation**: Survey confirms existence and scale of challenges
2. **Feature Prioritization**: Findings guide which features to build first
3. **Design Decisions**: Data patterns inform AI model training and UX design
4. **Impact Measurement**: Baseline metrics for evaluating SkillLens effectiveness

### Traceability
Every major SkillLens feature maps to a specific research finding, ensuring the solution addresses validated, real-world problems.

---

## 11. Expected Outcomes

### Anticipated Findings
- Majority of students lack awareness of rejection reasons
- Low ATS awareness correlates with lower success rates
- High application volume with low shortlisting rates
- Strong demand for personalized, AI-based guidance

### Contribution to Knowledge
- Empirical data on engineering student career readiness challenges
- Quantified impact of awareness factors on job application success
- Evidence-based justification for AI-driven career tools
