# Research Findings Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings from a survey of **100 engineering students** regarding resume preparation challenges and job application experiences. The research validates significant gaps in career readiness awareness and demonstrates strong demand for AI-based solutions.

---

## Key Statistical Findings

### 1. Awareness Gaps (Critical Problem Indicators)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **76% of students don't know why they were rejected** - Only 24% understand the specific reasons for their application failures.

- **ATS Awareness**: Only 26% are aware of Applicant Tracking Systems
- **Resume-JD Matching**: Only 24% are confident their resume matches job descriptions
- **Required Skills Knowledge**: 48% know what skills companies expect

### 2. Application Success Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Average Applications** | 40.5 | Students apply to many companies |
| **Average Shortlists** | 2.34 | Very low success rate |
| **Success Rate** | 9.53% | Less than 1 in 10 applications succeed |
| **Median Success Rate** | 3.54% | Half of students have <4% success |

> [!WARNING]
> **Students are applying extensively but failing to get shortlisted** - The median student submits 40+ applications but receives only 1-2 shortlists.

### 3. Impact of Knowledge Factors

#### ATS Awareness Impact (Statistically Significant, p < 0.01)

| Group | Avg Shortlists | Avg Applications | Success Rate |
|-------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **ATS Aware** | 6.08 | 20.8 | ~29% |
| **Not ATS Aware** | 1.03 | 47.5 | ~2% |
| **Impact Multiplier** | **5.9x** | - | **14.5x** |

> [!NOTE]
> **ATS-aware students have nearly 6x more shortlists** despite applying to fewer companies. This demonstrates the critical importance of targeted, informed applications.

#### Skills Knowledge Impact (Statistically Significant, p < 0.001)

| Group | Avg Shortlists | Success Rate |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Knows Required Skills** | 4.25 | ~18% |
| **Doesn't Know Skills** | 0.58 | ~1.5% |
| **Impact Multiplier** | **7.4x** | **12x** |

### 4. Correlation Analysis

| Relationship | Correlation (r) | Interpretation |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Resume Difficulty ↔ Shortlists** | -0.907 | Strong negative: Harder resume prep = fewer shortlists |
| **Applications ↔ Shortlists** | -0.877 | Strong negative: More applications ≠ more success |
| **ATS Aware → Shortlists** | +5.05 | Positive: ATS awareness = +5 shortlists on average |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Quantity ≠ Quality**: Students who apply to more companies actually get fewer shortlists. This suggests spray-and-pray approaches fail.

### 5. Problem Validation

| Problem Indicator | Percentage | Count |
|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **Applied but No Response** | 76% | 76 students |
| **Guidance is Generic** | 76% | 76 students |
| **Resume Difficulty (4-5/5)** | 50% | 50 students |

### 6. Solution Demand

> [!TIP]
> **100% of students believe an AI-based tool would help them** - Universal demand for intelligent career readiness solutions.

## Detailed Findings

### Finding 1: Rejection Reason Blindness

**Data**: 76% don't know why they were rejected

**Implications**:
- Students cannot improve without feedback
- Lack of transparency in hiring processes
- Need for explainable AI scoring

**SkillLens Solution**: Explainable readiness scores with specific improvement recommendations

---

### Finding 2: ATS Awareness Crisis

**Data**: 
- Only 26% aware of ATS
- ATS-aware students: 6.08 avg shortlists
- Non-ATS-aware students: 1.03 avg shortlists
- Chi-square test: χ² = 9.39, p = 0.002 (highly significant)

**Implications**:
- Most students' resumes are being filtered out automatically
- Lack of education on modern hiring technology
- Simple awareness dramatically improves outcomes

**SkillLens Solution**: ATS-aligned resume analysis and optimization

---

### Finding 3: Generic Guidance Problem

**Data**: 76% feel guidance is generic and not personalized

**Implications**:
- One-size-fits-all advice doesn't work
- Students need profile-specific recommendations
- Current career services are insufficient

**SkillLens Solution**: Adaptive AI learning agent with personalized guidance

---

### Finding 4: Application Volume Paradox

**Data**: 
- Correlation between applications and shortlists: r = -0.877
- High-volume applicants (50+ apps): 0.5 avg shortlists
- Low-volume applicants (15-25 apps): 6.5 avg shortlists

**Implications**:
- Spray-and-pray strategy is counterproductive
- Quality > Quantity in job applications
- Students need better targeting

**SkillLens Solution**: Predictive readiness modeling to identify best-fit opportunities

---

### Finding 5: Skills-Shortlist Mismatch

**Data**:
- 52% don't know required skills for target roles
- Skills-aware students: 7.4x more shortlists
- Chi-square test: χ² = 26.67, p < 0.001 (extremely significant)

**Implications**:
- Students lack market intelligence
- Resume content doesn't match job requirements
- Need for skill gap analysis

**SkillLens Solution**: Semantic resume-JD matching and skill gap identification

---

### Finding 6: Resume Preparation Difficulty

**Data**:
- Mean difficulty: 3.5/5 (moderate-difficult)
- 50% rate difficulty as 4-5/5
- Strong negative correlation with success (r = -0.907)

**Implications**:
- Students struggle with resume creation
- Difficulty directly predicts failure
- Need for guided resume building

**SkillLens Solution**: AI-powered resume builder with real-time feedback

## Statistical Validation

### Chi-Square Tests (Categorical Relationships)

| Test | χ² Statistic | p-value | Significant? | Interpretation |
|------|--------------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **ATS Awareness vs Success** | 9.39 | 0.002 | ✓ Yes | ATS awareness significantly predicts success |
| **Skills Knowledge vs Success** | 26.67 | <0.001 | ✓ Yes | Skills knowledge strongly predicts success |

Both relationships are statistically significant at p < 0.05 level, confirming these are not random patterns.
